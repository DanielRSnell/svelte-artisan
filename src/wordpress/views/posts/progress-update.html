<p>Hello, Artisans! We&#8217;re thrilled to share with you the latest steps we&#8217;ve been taking in our quest to craft the perfect web experience via our DOM Artisan website. Like an artist carefully refining a masterpiece, we&#8217;ve been conducting meticulous Quality Assurance (QA) to ensure you enjoy a seamless and inspiring journey with us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">🗺️ Navigation Update</h2>



<p>In our digital studio, we&#8217;ve noticed some navigational tweaks that need attention. Buttons such as <strong>Performance</strong>, <strong>Security</strong>, <strong>Teams</strong>, <strong>Contact</strong>, and <strong>Changelog</strong> are currently leading to unexpected destinations. But worry not, our skilled craftsmen are tweaking these with their coding chisels to ensure a smoother browsing experience!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">🏗️ Ongoing Construction</h2>



<p>A masterpiece is always a work in progress, and our DOM Artisan website is no different. Certain elements, particularly in the hero section, footer, and blog page, are still being crafted. Also, rest assured that the &#8220;phantom images&#8221; (broken or missing images) in the performance and integration sections are being replaced with captivating visuals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">🌱 Seeds for Future Growth</h2>



<p>We&#8217;re excited to share plans for new additions to our gallery! In the near future, we&#8217;ll be introducing a <strong>Beta Post</strong>, a sneak peek into our craft. We&#8217;re also diligently drafting a comprehensive <strong>Privacy Policy Page</strong> and an informative <strong>ChangeLog Page</strong>, ensuring you&#8217;re updated on all the nuances of our craft.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">🪚 Smoothing the Edges</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve noticed a few asymmetries and missing pieces in our digital canvas, including a shy YouTube video not making an appearance on individual posts. Fear not, our adept Artisans are working to correct these minor quirks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">🖌️ Aesthetic Enhancements</h2>



<p>We believe that details matter, and we&#8217;re adding finishing touches to various parts of our canvas for a more visually pleasing journey. This includes refining the <strong>Newsletter CTA</strong>, <strong>blog card preview</strong>, and <strong>author pages</strong>. Additionally, we&#8217;re enhancing the readability of code snippets and blocks within blog posts, highlighting them with a pleasant accent color.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">🧰 Toolbox Tweaks</h2>



<p>Just like maintaining our tools for an optimal crafting experience, we&#8217;re optimizing our website&#8217;s backend. This includes cleaning the header post formats and optimizing the <code>the_head()</code> function to enhance your user experience.</p>
